# Data_visualization

This project is done as a part of my data science learning journey,
where I completed IBM Data science course on edX. 
In this project, we aer performing data wrangling to clean and prepare the data, 
conducted thorough data analysis to understand the underlying patterns, developed a predictive model, and evaluated its performance
